**CDaaR (Central Dogma as a REST API)** is a Flask-based educational web service that models the molecular transcription and translation on cellular environments fundamental to genetics and genomics â€” including DNA reverse complementation, RNA transcription, reverse transcription to cDNA, and mRNA translation into polypeptides. Built for bioinformatics pipelines, teaching, and data validation, this API reflects on engineered natural selection, as intersection of biology with computing.

## API Endpoints

- ðŸ§¬ **/DNA/v2/**: Get the reverse complement of a DNA strand.
- ðŸ§« **/RNA/v2/**: Transcribe DNA to pre-mRNA using canonical base-pairing.
- ðŸ”„ **/CDNA/v2/**: Reverse transcribe mRNA into complementary double-stranded DNA.
- ðŸ§± **/Polypeptide/v2/**: Translate mRNA into a polypeptide chain of amino acids.

All endpoints:
- Enforce strict nucleotide validation using `Pydantic` models
- Limit input length to 10,000 characters
- Return biologically meaningful orientation (5â€™ â†’ 3â€™ and 3â€™ â†’ 5â€™)

## Example Use Case

```http
GET /RNA/v2/?seq=ATGC

Response:
{
  "Original": "ATGC",
  "RNA_Transcription": " 5'-AUGC-3' "
}

GET /Polypeptide/v2/?seq=AUGGCCAAGUAA

Response:
{
  "Codon": "AUGGCCAAGUAA",
  "Polypeptide": {
    "polypeptide": ["Methionine", "Alanine", "Lysine"],
    "length": 3
  }
}
```

## Installation

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/CDAAR-API.git
cd CDAAR-API
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
